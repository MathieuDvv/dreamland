## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

- Built with BabylonJS for 3D rendering
- Web-based implementation using JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering

### Architecture

The game is structured using a component-based architecture:

### Key Technical Features

#### PSX-Style Rendering

The retro aesthetic is achieved through:
- Vertex snapping to create the characteristic "jittery" PSX look
- Limited texture resolution and affine texture mapping
- Custom fragment shaders that simulate CRT scanlines and color depth limitations

#### Dolphin Physics

The dolphin's movement system features:
- Realistic water buoyancy and resistance
- Momentum-based jumping mechanics
- Trick detection system that analyzes rotation and position
- Simulated gravity and air resistance during jumps

#### Water Simulation

The tropical environment includes:
- Semi-realistic water surface using vertex displacement
- Dynamic wave patterns based on player movement
- Reflection and refraction effects for underwater scenery
- Particle systems for splashes and foam
